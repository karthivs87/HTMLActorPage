    Delna Davis entered the Tamil film industry and first worked on the film, Vidiyum Varai Pesu (2014) and then Patra (2015) by Jayanthan, alongside fellow newcomer Mithun Dev and entrepreneur-turned-actor Sam Paul. Portraying a college girl, Delna worked on the film alongside her examinations. Patra had a low profile release across Tamil Nadu in March 2015.[2][3][4] Her first Malayalam film, You Too Brutus (2015), also released on the same day, with the actress choosing to retain her original name for her work in Kerala.[5] Before the release of her initial films, Delna signed several other Tamil films including Gnanam's Aakkam and Palani's Oodha which were completed but did not have a theatrical release.[6] Her third and final release of 2015 was the political satire film 49-O (2015), which starred veteran comedian Goundamani in a leading role.[7]
